**Case Study: How Can a Wellness Technology Company Play It Smart?**

For this case study I am following the 6 steps of the data analysis process: Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share and Act.


Background: Bellabeat is a tech-driven female wellness company that specializes in the manufacturing of health focused smart products including Bellabeat app, leaf, spring, and the bellabeat subscription membership. Since its founding in 2013 the company has steadily grown into a world wide entity in the fitness tracking industry for women, but they have the potential to become an even larger player in the global market. Bellabeat has invested the majority of their resources into digital marketing, including Google and social media. 

**1. Ask** :turtle:

**Business Task**

Urška Sršen, co-founder and Chief Creative Officer of Bellabeat, believes that analyzing smart device fitness data could help unlock new growth opportunities for the company. I have been asked to focus on one of Bellabeat’s products and analyze smart device data to gain insight into how consumers are using their smart devices. I’ve chosen to focus on the Bellabeat app because it is the foundation of the company, and is the common thread woven throughout their products. 

**Stakeholders:**

Urška Sršen: Bellabeat’s co-founder and Chief Creative Officer

Sando Mur: Mathematician, Bellabeat’s co-founder and key member of the Bellabeat executive team

Bellabeat marketing analytics team: A team of data analysts guiding Bellabeat’s marketing strategy. 

***2. Prepare*** :mage:

The data is stored and publicly available at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit

The dataset has 30 participant’s FitBit Fitness Tracker Data, comprising 18 CSV files.

**ROCCC: Is it good or bad data?**

Reliability: The data is from 30 FitBit users that consented to submit their personal tracker data. Upon further review there are 33 unique IDs for the daily data sets, 24 for sleep data, and only 8 for the weight log data. The 33 sources of data is enough to meet the generally accepted threshold of 30 participants, however a sample size this small will not provide a highly informed analysis. 

Original: Data collected from 3rd Party Amazon Mechanical Turk, data is not original.

Comprehensive: The data includes the date, total steps taken, total distance covered, whether the time spent was sedentary, lightly active, fairly active, or very active, and how many calories were burned. There is also data covering sleep metrics, and a weight log. However, we don’t know anything else about the participants.

Current: The data is from April 2016 to May 2016. Although the data is 7 years old, it should represent a general theme amongst FitBit wearers that hasn’t changed with time. 

Cited: Although the data is cited it is collected from unknown sources which may be unreliable.
